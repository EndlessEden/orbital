Orbital is a shell for Wayland's Weston.
It is composed of a Weston shell plugin and a shell client, made in Qt5,
with the interface in QtQuick 2.
Its goal is to produce a light and self-contained shell running on Wayland,
without many dependencies aside Weston and Qt.

1. DEPENDENCIES
Orbital depends on two things: Weston git master and Qt 5.1.
Since it uses QtQuick 2 to draw the interface it will make use of OpenGL,
so it is advisable to use a decent graphics driver, otherwise the performance
will not be good.
You also need QtWayland, preferably from git (branch 'stable') as Qt does not
provide a Wayland backend by default. You do not need QtCompositor, the
platform plugin is enough.

2. COMPILING ORBITAL
To compile Orbital run this commands from the repository root directory:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

Orbital will be installed in the "/usr/local" prefix, unless you specified
otherwise using the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable:
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/prefix ..

3. RUNNING ORBITAL
Now you can just run 'orbital', to run it. If you run it inside an X session
it will run in windowed mode, otherwise running it from a tty will start its
own dedicated session.

4. CONFIGURING ORBITAL
The first time you start Orbital it will load a default configuration. If you
save the configuration (by closing the config dialog or by going from edit mode
to normal mode) it will save the configuration file "orbital.conf", in
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME or, if not set, in $HOME/.config. You can manually modify
the configuration file, but Orbital has (or will have) graphical tools
for configuring the environment.
